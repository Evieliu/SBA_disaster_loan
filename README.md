# SBA Disaster Loan Analysis

This is an initial analysis of the SBA Disaster Loans dataset provided by IRE through a FOIA request to SBA. The data contains information on 1,314,508 loans from 1979 through February 18, 2016. In an effort to give some insight to the recovery prospect of Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, I looked at the data with a focus on home loans associated with natural disasters declared between 2006 and 2016, especially those incurred by hurricanes. 

<b>Questions to ask</b></br>
<li>How many disaster loans were incurred by hurricanes in the past decade? What's the estimated value?</li></br>
<li>How long does it take applicants to get their disaster loans approved (longest time and general distribution)?</li></br>
<li>How does it differ between states and disasters?</li></br>

<b>Limitation of data</b></br>

<li>The data does not include exact dates when people submitted their applications, which should be some time between the date when the disaster was declared and the deadline to file an application associated with that disaster. The waiting days are therefore estimates based on both dates and not accurate.</li></br>

<li>The data does not include records for loan applications that weren't approved.</li></br>

<li>The approved loans in the data are not necessarily fully distributed.</li></br>
