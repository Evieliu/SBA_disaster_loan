# SBA Disaster Loan Analysis

This is an initial analysis of the SBA Disaster Loans dataset provided by IRE through a FOIA request to SBA. The data contains information on 1,314,508 loans from 1979 through February 18, 2016. In this analysis, I only focused on the home loans associated with natural disasters declared between 2006 and 2016, especially those incurred by hurricanes.

A few questions: 
How long does it take disaster loan applicants to get the approval?
How much 

<b>Limitation of data:<b>

<li>The data does not include exact dates when people submitted their applications. It should be some time between the date when the disaster was declared and the deadline to file an application associated with that disaster. The waiting days are estimates based on both dates and are therefore not accurate.</li>

The data does not include records for loan applications that weren't approved.

The approved loans in the data are not necessarily fully distributed.
